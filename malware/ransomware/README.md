# Simple Ransomware (Beginner PoC)

This directory contains a **Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Simple Ransomware** implemented in Python, designed specifically for beginners to understand the fundamental concepts behind ransomware attacks.

Our goal is to demystify how these threats operate by examining a simplified version, focusing on core mechanics rather than advanced evasion or cryptographic techniques.

## 🎯 Purpose

The main purpose of building and analyzing this simple ransomware code is to:

*   **Understand How It Works:** Grasp the basic steps that ransomware takes to "hijack" data.
*   **Analyze Attacker Mindset:** Examine how an attacker thinks about executing an attack.
*   **Highlight the Danger:** Show that creating a basic form of malware is not overly complex, thereby raising awareness about exercising caution when running files from unknown sources.
*   **Distinguish Encoding from Encryption:** Clearly understand the difference between simple *encoding* (like Base64) and robust *encryption* (like AES) used by real ransomware.

## 🔬 How It Works: Step-by-Step

`ransomware.py` performs the following steps:

### **1. Discover and Identify Target Files**
The script scans the current directory for files it can encrypt. It intentionally skips `ransomware.py` itself and `README.md` to avoid self-destruction.

### **2. "Encrypt" File Content (Using Base64)**
*   It opens each target file and reads its entire content.
*   It uses `base64` to *encode* the content. **IMPORTANT NOTE:** Base64 is NOT a strong encryption algorithm! It's merely a method to represent binary data in text format. Real ransomware would use much stronger encryption algorithms like AES.
*   It overwrites the original file with the Base64-encoded content.

### **3. Display Ransom Note**
After all target files have been "encrypted," the script displays a simple message on the screen, demanding the user send money to a specified cryptocurrency address to receive the decryption key.

### **4. Decrypt Files (If Key is Correct)**
*   The user is prompted to enter a "decryption key."
*   If the key matches the hardcoded key (`fr33_my_f1l3s_n0w`), the script repeats the file discovery process and uses `base64` to *decode* the content, restoring the file to its original state.
*   If the key is incorrect, the files remain encrypted.

## 🚀 How to Run It

**Critical Warning:** Always run this code in a safe, isolated environment (e.g., a virtual machine) and only on files that you **explicitly agree** to be modified. Do not run it on critical files or systems!

To simulate the ransomware's behavior:

1.  **Create a test text file** in the same directory as `ransomware.py`, for example: `target_file.txt` with content "This is a secret message."

2.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python3 ransomware.py
    ```
    You will see a series of `DEBUG` messages showing the encryption process, followed by the ransom note and a prompt to enter the decryption key:
    ```
    DEBUG:root:SimpleRansomware:Skipping excluded file: ransomware.py
    DEBUG:root:SimpleRansomware:Skipping excluded file: README.md
    DEBUG:root:SimpleRansomware:Found 1 target file(s).
    DEBUG:root:SimpleRansomware:Successfully encrypted: /path/to/malware/ransomware/target_file.txt

    ==================================================
    Your files have been encrypted!
    To get the decryption key, please send 666 USD in BTC to address XYZ.
    ==================================================

    Number of files encrypted: 1
    Please enter the decryption key to restore your files:
    ```

3.  **Check the encrypted file:** Open `target_file.txt` in a text editor. You will see its content changed to a Base64 string (e.g., `VGhpcyBpcyBhIHNlY3JldCBtZXNzYWdlLg==`).

4.  **Decrypt:** At the prompt, enter the correct key:
    ```
    Please enter the decryption key to restore your files: fr33_my_f1l3s_n0w
    ```
    You will see a confirmation message, and `target_file.txt` will be restored to its original content.

## 💡 Key Learnings

*   **Surprising Simplicity:** Even with basic programming knowledge, you can create a program capable of "locking" files. This highlights the importance of not running untrusted scripts.
*   **Encoding vs. Encryption:** Base64 is merely a way to reformat data. Real encryption requires more complex algorithms and secure key management.
*   **Defense is Crucial:** Understanding how attackers build their tools helps us better comprehend effective defense mechanisms. Always back up your data, use antivirus software, and be wary of suspicious files.
