# The OSI Model

> This section will break down the OSI Model, a foundational concept in networking. We'll go through the seven layers to understand how data travels from one application to another across a network.

### 🍰 The 7 Layers (Coming Soon!)

1.  **Physical Layer**: The wires, cables, and hardware.
2.  **Data Link Layer**: How data moves between devices on the same network (MAC addresses live here!).
3.  **Network Layer**: The "GPS" of the network (IP addresses and routing happen here).
4.  **Transport Layer**: Ensures data gets delivered reliably (TCP vs. UDP).
5.  **Session Layer**: Manages the conversation between two devices.
6.  **Presentation Layer**: Formats and encrypts data to be presentable.
7.  **Application Layer**: The layer you interact with (HTTP, FTP, etc.).
