# Hackbook

**Hackbook** is my long‑term, structured notebook for becoming a real pentester. It is not just a collection of commands — it is a record of concepts, experiments, failures, and breakthroughs across every domain of cybersecurity.

This repository will grow over time as I learn more topics. For now, only the **tooling** section exists, but the structure is designed to scale into a complete pentesting knowledge base.

## 📦 Current Sections

### 🔧 Tooling

A curated, structured collection of the essential tools every offensive security practitioner must understand.

→ **[Go to /tooling](./tooling/)**

This section includes categories like:

* Recon & Scanning
* Sniffing & Traffic Analysis
* Wireless Attacks
* Password Cracking
* Exploitation Frameworks
* Post‑Exploitation
* Utilities

Each category focuses on:

* The purpose of the tool
* How it works internally
* Real attacker use‑cases
* Practical examples

## 🧭 Future Roadmap

Hackbook is intended to expand far beyond tooling. Planned sections include:

### 🕸️ Network Fundamentals

Packet flow, OSI logic, routing, switching, VLAN, ARP, DHCP, DNS.

### 🛠️ Pentesting Workflow

Realistic end‑to‑end methodology: recon → exploitation → privilege escalation → persistence → reporting.

### 💥 Offensive Techniques

Bruteforce, phishing, WiFi attacks, web exploitation, buffer overflows.

### 🧱 Defensive Understanding

Detection, logs, SIEM, blue‑team perspective for better offensive skills.

### 📑 Labs & Walkthroughs

Write‑ups of TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and custom labs.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

To build a **permanent record** of my journey from beginner to professional red teamer. Everything is written clearly, deeply, and practically — with a focus on *why* something works, not just the commands.

This is my personal knowledge base, but structured so anyone can learn from it.
