# TryHackMe Labs

This section contains my personal write-ups and solutions for various rooms on the [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) platform. Each write-up aims to detail the methodology, tools used, vulnerabilities exploited, and key learnings from completing the room.

My goal is not just to provide answers, but to document the thought process and techniques applied, reinforcing my understanding and serving as a reference for future challenges.

## 📌 Overview

TryHackMe offers a wide range of hands-on labs and learning paths covering different domains of cybersecurity, including:

*   **Network Security:** Reconnaissance, scanning, sniffing, firewall bypass.
*   **Web Hacking:** OWASP Top 10, SQL injection, XSS, file uploads.
*   **System Exploitation:** Privilege escalation (Linux & Windows), buffer overflows.
*   **Forensics & Incident Response:** Log analysis, memory forensics.
*   **OSINT:** Open-Source Intelligence techniques.

Each room typically presents a simulated environment or a series of tasks designed to teach specific concepts and practical skills.

## 🧠 Methodology for Write-ups

When approaching a TryHackMe room, I generally follow these steps, which are reflected in the write-ups:

1.  **Reconnaissance:** Initial scanning and enumeration to understand the target.
2.  **Vulnerability Identification:** Pinpointing weaknesses through analysis.
3.  **Exploitation:** Gaining initial access using identified vulnerabilities.
4.  **Privilege Escalation:** Elevating privileges to root/administrator.
5.  **Post-Exploitation/Flag Capture:** Locating and submitting flags, exploring the compromised system.
6.  **Learnings & Reflection:** Summarizing new knowledge and techniques.
