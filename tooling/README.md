# Tooling

The **tooling** directory contains the core tools every pentester must understand — focusing on *why* each tool matters, how it works internally, and how it fits into real offensive workflows.

Pentesting is not about memorizing commands. It’s about understanding the tools and the logic behind them.

## 🔍 Categories

Tools are organized by offensive capability to keep the structure scalable as Hackbook grows.

### **1. Reconnaissance & Scanning**
Discover hosts, services, and ports.  
→ **[Go to /recon](./recon/)**

---

### **2. Traffic Analysis & Sniffing**
Capture, inspect, and analyze packets.  
→ **[Go to /sniffing](./sniffing/)**

---

### **3. Wireless Attacks**
802.11 frames, WPA/PMKID attacks, WiFi exploitation.  
→ **[Go to /wireless](./wireless/)**

---

### **4. Password Cracking & Hash Attacks**
Bruteforce, hash cracking, key generation.  
→ **[Go to /password-cracking](./password-cracking/)**

---

### **5. Exploitation Frameworks**
Modular platforms for automating exploitation.  
→ **[Go to /exploitation](./exploitation/)**

---

### **6. Post-Exploitation & Privilege Escalation**
Maintain access, escalate privileges, lateral movement.  
→ **[Go to /post-exploitation](./post-exploitation/)**

---

### **7. Utilities & System Essentials**
Helper tools that support the pentest workflow.  
→ **[Go to /utilities](./utilities/)**

## 🧠 Philosophy

Each tool entry explains:

* What it does  
* Why a pentester needs it  
* How it works internally (protocols, packet flow, OS interaction)  
* Real attacker use-cases  
* Example commands  

This section is about understanding, not memorization.

## 📈 Future Scope

As Hackbook expands, tooling will integrate with:

* Network fundamentals  
* Pentesting methodology  
* Labs & walkthroughs
