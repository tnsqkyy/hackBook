# Wireless Attacks

The **wireless** category covers Wi-Fi hacking, 802.11 frame behavior, capture methods, and real attack workflows. The goal is to understand how wireless protocols behave at the packet level — not just how to run commands.

Wireless attacks are a common entry point in real assessments, so mastering them is essential.

## 📡 What This Section Covers

- 802.11 frames (management, control, data)  
- Monitor mode, injection, chipset capabilities  
- Capturing WPA/WPA2 handshakes  
- PMKID attacks  
- Deauthentication and frame manipulation  
- Converting captures to crackable formats  
- Tool workflows and analysis techniques  

---

## 🔧 Tools Included

Each tool includes its own README.

### **Aircrack-NG Suite**  
Classic Wi-Fi auditing toolkit for capture, attack, conversion, and cracking.  
→ **[Go to /aircrack-ng](./aircrack-ng/)**

(Other tools like **hcxdumptool** and **wifite** will be added later.)

## 🧠 Philosophy

Wireless hacking is about understanding:

- how frames move through the air,  
- how clients authenticate,  
- how access points respond,  
- and how attackers can capture or disrupt those interactions.

Every guide here focuses on **why the attack works**, not just the commands.
